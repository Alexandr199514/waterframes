# WATERFrAMES
Based on CreativeMD LittleFrames.
In first place. I planned to do a backport and use the LittleFrames on it.
But we made a LOT OF USELESS CHANGES. Original code are full of junk. Also is incompatible 
with FancyVideo-Api

For now. WATERFrAMES wants to be a better option over LittleFrames
